# TikTok Link Solution - "Action Cannot Be Completed"

## The Problem
TikTok has strict security measures that block:
- Direct App Store links in some cases
- Redirects
- Suspicious domains
- Some JavaScript redirects

## ✅ Best Solution: Use Linktree or Similar Service

**These services are specifically designed to work with TikTok:**

### Option 1: Linktree (Recommended)
1. Go to [linktr.ee](https://linktr.ee) - Sign up (free)
2. Add your profile:
   - Name: GoFitAI
   - Bio: Your AI-Powered Fitness Coach
   - Profile picture: Your app icon
3. Add link:
   - Title: "Download on App Store"
   - URL: `https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gofitai/id6752763510`
4. Get your Linktree URL: `linktr.ee/yourusername`
5. Use this Linktree link in your TikTok bio

**Why this works:**
- Linktree is a trusted domain that TikTok allows
- Millions of creators use it
- Optimized for social media platforms

### Option 2: Carrd (Alternative)
1. Go to [carrd.co](https://carrd.co) - Sign up (free)
2. Create a simple page with App Store button
3. Get your Carrd URL
4. Use in TikTok bio

### Option 3: Bio.link
1. Go to [bio.link](https://bio.link) - Sign up (free)
2. Add App Store link
3. Get your bio.link URL
4. Use in TikTok bio

## Alternative: Try the Landing Page

I've updated `tiktok.html` to be a proper landing page (not a redirect). 

**After redeploying to Netlify:**
1. Use: `https://your-site.netlify.app/tiktok`
2. This shows a landing page with a button
3. User clicks button → Goes to App Store

**This might work better than a redirect because:**
- It's a real page, not a redirect
- User clicks a button (user-initiated action)
- TikTok allows user-initiated navigation

## Why TikTok Blocks Links

TikTok blocks links to prevent:
- Spam
- Phishing
- Malicious redirects
- Unauthorized app installs

**Solution:** Use trusted services (Linktree, Carrd) or landing pages with user-initiated clicks.

Consider getting a custom domain and using a service like:

But for now, **Linktree is the fastest and most reliable solution**.

**Alternative:** Use the landing page (`tiktok.html`) after redeploying to Netlify, but Linktree is more reliable.
