## 📋 What Apple Requires:

### In App Binary (✅ DONE):
- ✅ Title of subscription (Monthly Plan, Lifetime Access)
- ✅ Length of subscription (Monthly, Lifetime)
- ✅ Price ($9.99/month, $79.99)
- ✅ Functional links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

### In App Store Connect Metadata (⚠️ STILL NEEDED):

1. **App Description** must include:
   - Link to Terms of Use (EULA)
   - Link to Privacy Policy (optional but good practice)

2. **Privacy Policy URL Field** (in App Information):
   - Must be filled with: `https://henryizi.github.io/gofitai-privacy/`

3. **EULA Field** (Alternative to App Description):
   - Can add custom EULA in App Store Connect instead of link in description
   - But link in description is easier

---

## 🎯 Action Items:

### Step 1: Update App Description
1. Go to App Store Connect → Your App → App Information
2. Find "Description" field
3. Use the description above (includes Terms of Use link)
4. Save

### Step 2: Update Privacy Policy URL
1. Same page (App Information)
2. Find "Privacy Policy URL" field
3. Enter: `https://henryizi.github.io/gofitai-privacy/`
4. Save

### Step 3: Verify EULA Field (Optional)
1. Check if there's an "EULA" field in App Information
2. If using custom EULA, you can upload it there
3. OR just use the link in description (easier)

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist:

- [ ] App Description has Terms of Use link
- [ ] App Description has Privacy Policy link (recommended)
- [ ] Privacy Policy URL field is filled in App Store Connect
- [ ] Links work when clicked
- [ ] All subscription info is in description (price, length, trial)

---

## 💡 Why This Matters:

Apple requires BOTH:
1. Links in the app binary (✅ DONE)
2. Links in App Store Connect metadata (⚠️ DO THIS)

Without the App Store Connect links, Apple will reject again!
