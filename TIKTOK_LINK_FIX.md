# TikTok Link Fix - "Action Cannot Be Done" Error

## Problem
TikTok blocks certain types of redirects and shows "action cannot be done" error when clicking bio links.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Direct App Store Link (Recommended for TikTok)
**Use this link directly in your TikTok bio:**
```
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gofitai/id6752763510
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works 100% on TikTok
- ✅ No redirect issues
- ✅ Fastest loading

**Cons:**
- ❌ Long URL (but TikTok shortens it automatically)

---

### Option 2: Use TikTok-Compatible HTML Page
I've created `tiktok.html` that uses multiple redirect methods for TikTok compatibility.

**Use this link in TikTok bio:**
```
https://your-site.netlify.app/tiktok
```

This serves an HTML page with:
- Meta refresh redirect
- JavaScript redirect
- Manual button fallback

---

### Option 3: Use Linktree or Similar Service
Services like Linktree are optimized for social media platforms:

1. **Linktree** (linktr.ee) - Free tier available
2. **Carrd** (carrd.co) - Free tier available
3. **Bio.link** (bio.link) - Free

These services are specifically designed to work with TikTok, Instagram, etc.

## Recommended Setup for TikTok

### Best Practice:
1. **For TikTok bio:** Use direct App Store link
   ```
   https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gofitai/id6752763510
   ```

2. **For other platforms:** Use your short link
   ```
   https://your-site.netlify.app/app
   ```

3. **Alternative:** Use Linktree with App Store link inside

## Testing Your Link

1. **Test on TikTok:**
   - Go to your TikTok profile
   - Click the link in your bio
   - Should open App Store directly

2. **If it still doesn't work:**
   - Try the direct App Store link
   - Or use Linktree/Carrd service

## Why TikTok Blocks Some Links

TikTok has security measures that block:
- JavaScript redirects (sometimes)
- Meta refresh redirects (sometimes)
- Suspicious domains
- Redirect chains

**Solution:** Use direct links or services optimized for social media.
