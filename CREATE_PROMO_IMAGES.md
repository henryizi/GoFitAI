# How to Create Promotional Images from HTML Templates

## 🎯 Quick Method (5 Minutes)

I've created HTML templates for both images. Here's how to use them:

### Step 1: Open HTML Files
1. Open `monthly-premium-promo.html` in your browser
2. Open `lifetime-premium-promo.html` in your browser

### Step 2: Take Screenshots
1. **For Monthly:**
   - Open `monthly-premium-promo.html` in Chrome/Safari
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+4` (Mac) or use Snipping Tool (Windows)
   - Select the orange card (1024x1024 area)
   - Save as `monthly-premium-promo.png`

2. **For Lifetime:**
   - Open `lifetime-premium-promo.html` in Chrome/Safari
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+4` (Mac) or use Snipping Tool (Windows)
   - Select the black card with orange border (1024x1024 area)
   - Save as `lifetime-premium-promo.png`

### Step 3: Verify Size
- Both images should be 1024 x 1024 pixels
- File size should be under 5MB

### Step 4: Upload to App Store Connect
1. Go to App Store Connect → Your App → In-App Purchases
2. Monthly subscription → Promotional Image → Upload `monthly-premium-promo.png`
