# ✅ Network Connection Issue - FIXED!

## 🔧 **What Was the Problem?**

Your React Native app was trying to connect to `http://127.0.0.1:4000` (localhost), but React Native apps running on devices/simulators can't reach localhost. They need to connect to your computer's actual IP address on the network.

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

1. **✅ Updated `.env` file**:
   - **Before**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.0.199:4000` (old IP)
   - **After**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.0.100:4000` (current IP)

2. **✅ Verified server configuration**:
   - Server is properly listening on `0.0.0.0:4000` (all network interfaces)
   - Server responds correctly to network requests
   - CORS is properly configured

3. **✅ Tested connectivity**:
   - ✅ `http://192.168.0.100:4000/ping` → `pong`
   - ✅ `http://192.168.0.100:4000/api/health` → `{"status":"healthy"}`

## 🚀 **Next Steps - RESTART YOUR APP:**

To apply the fix, you need to restart your React Native development server:

### **Option 1: In Your Current Terminal**
Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the current `npm run dev`, then restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Option 2: If Using Expo**
Press `r` in the Expo terminal to reload, or restart with:
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

## ✅ **Expected Results After Restart:**

- ✅ No more "Network request failed" errors
- ✅ Server status should show "Connected"
- ✅ AI workout plans will generate successfully
- ✅ Nutrition tracking will work
- ✅ All server-dependent features will be functional

## 🔍 **How to Verify It's Working:**

1. **Open your app**
2. **Check server status** - should show green/connected
3. **Try generating a workout plan** - should work without errors
4. **Try nutrition features** - should work normally

## 📱 **Technical Details:**

- **Your Computer IP**: `192.168.0.100`
- **Server Port**: `4000`
- **API URL**: `http://192.168.0.100:4000`
- **Server Status**: ✅ Running and accessible

## 🛠 **If Issues Persist:**

If you still see connection errors after restarting:

1. **Check your WiFi network** - make sure phone/simulator is on same network
2. **Verify IP hasn't changed**:
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v "127.0.0.1"
   ```
3. **Check firewall settings** - ensure port 4000 is accessible

Your GoFitAI app should now connect successfully! 🎯
