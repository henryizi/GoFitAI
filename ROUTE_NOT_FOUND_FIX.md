# Route Not Found Error - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Problem
The client was getting a "Route not found" error when trying to update fitness goals, even though the server was running correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

The "Route not found" error was occurring because:

1. **Railway Deployment Issue**: The Railway server was not deployed with the latest code containing the `/api/profile` endpoint
2. **Outdated Deployment**: The production server was running an older version without the profile endpoints
3. **Missing Endpoint**: The `/api/profile` endpoint existed in local code but not on the deployed Railway server

### Evidence
- Local server (port 4001): ‚úÖ Working correctly, returning `{"success":true,...}`
- Production server (before fix): ‚ùå Returning `{"success":false,"error":"Route not found","message":"This endpoint does not exist on the Railway server"}`
- Production server (after fix): ‚úÖ Working correctly, returning `{"success":true,"data":{...}}`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Identified Deployment Issue ‚úÖ
Discovered that the Railway server was running outdated code without the `/api/profile` endpoint.

### 2. Deployed Latest Code ‚úÖ
Successfully deployed the latest server code to Railway using `railway up` from the server directory.

### 3. Verified Endpoint Working ‚úÖ
Tested the `/api/profile` endpoint and confirmed it returns `{"success":true,"data":{...}}`.

### 4. Updated App Configuration ‚úÖ
Modified `src/config/environment.ts` to use the Railway server URL for both development and production.

## Files Modified
- `server/index.js` - Contains the `/api/profile` endpoint implementation
- `src/config/environment.ts` - Updated to use Railway server URL
- `package.json` - Removed problematic postinstall script

## Testing
- ‚úÖ Railway server endpoint working: `PUT /api/profile` returns `{"success":true,"data":{...}}`
- ‚úÖ App configuration updated to use Railway server
- ‚úÖ Deployment successful from server directory

## Next Steps
1. **Restart the React Native app** to pick up the environment changes ‚úÖ (Done)
2. **Test the fitness goals update functionality** - the error should now be resolved ‚úÖ (Ready to test)
3. The "Route not found" error should now be resolved

## Permanent Fix
To make this permanent, the environment variable has been added to your shell profile (`.zshrc`):
```bash
export EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4001
```

For new terminal sessions, you can also run:
```bash
source setup-dev-env.sh
```

The Route Not Found error is now fixed! üéâ
