## üéØ **Specific Test Cases for Plan Selection**

   - Success message should appear: "Plan activated successfully!"
   - Button should disappear from the newly active plan

### **Test Case 2: Switching Between Plans**

### **Test Case 4: Database Integration**
1. Select a plan with a valid UUID (database plan)
