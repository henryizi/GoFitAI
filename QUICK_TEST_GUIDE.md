```

### Problem = Any Red ❌
```

   → May need additional debugging
```

## �� If Deployment Isn't Complete Yet

### Check Railway Status
```bash
# Open Railway dashboard:
# https://railway.app/project/[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]

# Look for:
1. Recent builds in the Deployments section
2. Build should show "Building..." or "Deployed"
3. Check logs for any build errors
```

### If Still Failing
```
1. Wait another 2-3 minutes (builds can be slow)
2. Refresh the browser completely (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Clear app cache on mobile if needed
4. Try creating a NEW plan (not editing old ones)
```
