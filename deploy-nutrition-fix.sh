- Removed composeNutritionPrompt() - dead code from old AI system
- Removed composeReevaluationPrompt() - dead code from old AI system  
- Nutrition plan generation now uses mathematical calculations exclusively
- Nutrition re-evaluation uses mathematical calculations exclusively
- AI calls removed from all nutrition functionality
- Only workout plans and chat features still use AI

Fixes Railway logs showing AI calls for nutrition functionality."
