# Quick Workout Feature

## Overview
The Quick Workout feature allows users to start an impromptu workout session without following their pre-planned workout routine. Users can browse the exercise library, select exercises on the fly, configure sets/reps/rest times, and instantly start logging their workout - all with the same rest timer and logging functionality as regular planned workouts.

## Key Features

### 1. **Exercise Library Browser**

### 3. **Exercise Configuration**
For each selected exercise, users can customize:
- **Sets**: Adjust from 1-10 sets using +/- buttons
- **Reps**: Free text input (supports ranges like "8-12" or specific numbers)
- **Rest Time**: Quick select from 60s, 90s, 120s, or 180s

### 4. **Seamless Integration**
- Uses the existing session execution screen (`[sessionId]-premium.tsx`)

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure

```
app/(main)/workout/
  ├── quick-workout.tsx          # Main Quick Workout screen
  ├── plans.tsx                   # Updated with Quick Workout button
  └── session/
      └── [sessionId]-premium.tsx # Execution screen (already exists)
```

### Key Components

#### **QuickWorkoutScreen** (`quick-workout.tsx`)
Main component that handles:
- Exercise library loading via `ExerciseService`
- Search and filtering logic
- Exercise selection state management
- Workout configuration
- Navigation to session execution

**State Management:**
```typescript
- exercises: Exercise[]                    // All available exercises
- selectedExercises: QuickWorkoutExercise[] // User's workout
- searchQuery: string                      // Search filter
- selectedMuscleGroup: string             // Muscle filter
- showExerciseLibrary: boolean            // View toggle
```

**Key Functions:**
- `loadExercises()`: Fetches exercise library from database
- `filteredExercises`: Memoized filtering based on search and muscle group
- `handleAddExercise()`: Adds exercise to workout with default config
- `handleRemoveExercise()`: Removes exercise and reorders
- `handleUpdateExercise()`: Updates sets/reps/rest for an exercise
- `handleStartWorkout()`: Navigates to session execution with workout data

#### **Session Execution Integration**
Quick workouts use the existing session execution screen by:
1. Creating a custom session ID: `quick-${Date.now()}`
2. Passing exercises as `fallbackExercises` parameter
3. Setting `sessionTitle` to "Quick Workout"

The session screen already supports fallback exercises (originally for custom workout builder), so no changes needed there.

### Data Flow

```

{
  sessionId: "quick-1234567890",
  sessionTitle: "Quick Workout",

      id: "exercise-uuid",
      name: "Bench Press",
      sets: 3,
      reps: "8-12",
      rest: "90s",

    },
    ...

}

### Database Integration

**No new tables needed!** Quick workouts leverage existing infrastructure:

- **Exercises**: Uses existing `exercises` table via `ExerciseService`
- **Workout History**: Saved to `workout_history` table as standalone workouts (no plan_id)
- **Exercise Logs**: Uses existing `exercise_logs` table (if real exercise IDs)

**History Entry Structure:**
```typescript
{
  user_id: string,
  plan_id: null,               // Standalone workout
  session_id: null,            // Not part of a plan
  plan_name: "Custom Workout",
  session_name: "Quick Workout",
  completed_at: timestamp,
  duration_minutes: number,
  total_sets: number,
  total_exercises: number,
  estimated_calories: number,
  exercises_data: [...]        // Detailed exercise logs
}
```
