## 🔄 User Flow

### The New, Improved Flow:

```
Workout Plans Screen
    ↓ [Tap Lightning Bolt ⚡]
Empty Workout Session
    ↓ [Tap "Add First Exercise"]
Exercise Picker Modal
    ↓ [Search/Filter → Select Exercise]
Workout Session (1 exercise)
    ↓ [Log sets → Rest timer]
    ↓ [Tap + FAB to add another exercise]
Exercise Picker Modal

### Key Difference from Original Plan:
- **BEFORE**: Choose all exercises → Configure all → Start logging
- **NOW**: Start empty → Add exercise → Log it → Add next → Repeat

This matches the user's request: **"during the workout, not right before"**

## 💾 Data Handling

### Exercise Addition:
- Creates synthetic exercise set with unique ID: `ex-${sessionId}-${order}`
- Updates `sets` array dynamically
- Updates `exerciseMap` with exercise name
- If first exercise: resets currentIndex to 0 to start workout

### Workout Session:
- Session ID: `quick-${timestamp}`
- Starts with empty exercises array: `fallbackExercises: []`
- `isQuickWorkout` flag set to `true` when sessionId starts with "quick-"

### Workout History:
- Saved as standalone workout (no `plan_id` or `session_id`)
- Includes all exercise logs with sets, reps, weights
- Calorie tracking and duration
- Accessible in workout history screen

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Color Scheme:
- **Quick Workout**: Purple → Pink gradient (`#AF52DE` → `#FF2D92`)
  - Symbolizes spontaneity and flexibility
  - Distinct from planned workouts (orange)
  - High energy, fun vibe
- **FAB**: Purple/pink gradient with + icon
- **Lightning bolt**: Universal symbol for "quick"

### Layout:
- **Empty State**: Dumbbell icon, encouraging message, large CTA button

  - Search bar with clear icon
  - Horizontal scrolling filter chips
  - Scrollable exercise list
