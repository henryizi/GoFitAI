# Previous Workout Data Feature

## Overview
This feature displays the user's last performance for each exercise during workout logging, helping them track progress and make informed decisions about weight and rep progression.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Service: PreviousExerciseService
**File:** `src/services/workout/PreviousExerciseService.ts`

This service provides methods to fetch previous exercise performance data:

- `getLastPerformedExercise(userId, exerciseId)`: Fetches the most recent performance for a single exercise
- `getLastPerformedExercises(userId, exerciseIds[])`: Batch fetches previous data for multiple exercises (more efficient)

#### Data Structure
```typescript
interface PreviousExerciseData {
  exerciseId: string;
  exerciseName: string;
  lastPerformed: string | null; // ISO date string
  sets: {
    reps: number;
    weight: number | null;
    weightUnit: 'kg' | 'lbs';
    completedAt: string;
  }[];
  topSetWeight: number | null;
  totalVolume: number;
}
```

#### Data Sources
The service queries workout history in the following priority:
1. **Primary**: `workout_history` table - Checks the `exercises_data` JSONB column for stored exercise logs
2. **Fallback**: `exercise_logs` table - For older data that may not be in workout_history

### 2. UI Integration
**File:** `app/(main)/workout/session/[sessionId]-premium.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
1. **Import**: Added `PreviousExerciseService` import
2. **State**: Added `previousExerciseData` state to store the Map of exercise ID â†’ previous performance data
3. **Data Fetching**: Added `useEffect` hook that:
   - Triggers when exercises are loaded
   - Batch fetches previous data for all exercises in the session
   - Skips synthetic/fallback exercise IDs (those starting with 'ex-id-')
4. **UI Display**: Added new section showing:
   - Last performance date (formatted as "X days ago", "Yesterday", etc.)
   - List of all sets performed (reps and weight)
   - Total volume and top set weight statistics
   - Automatic unit conversion to match user's current preference

#### UI Features:
- **Conditional Display**: Only shows if previous data exists for the current exercise
- **Smart Date Formatting**: 
  - "Today" / "Yesterday" for recent workouts
  - "X days ago" for within a week
  - "X weeks ago" for within a month
  - Full date for older workouts
- **Weight Unit Conversion**: Automatically converts stored weight to user's current preferred unit
- **Visual Design**: 
  - Gradient background with primary color accent border
  - Icon with "history" indicator
  - Clean, readable set-by-set breakdown
  - Summary statistics at the bottom

### 3. Styles
Added comprehensive styling for the previous workout section:
- `previousWorkoutSection`: Container with rounded corners
- `previousWorkoutGradient`: Gradient background with accent border
- `previousWorkoutHeader`: Header with icon, title, and date
- `previousSetsList`: Container for set rows
- `previousSetRow`: Individual set display with rep and weight info
- `previousWorkoutStats`: Summary statistics section

## User Experience Flow

1. User starts a workout session
2. Service automatically fetches previous performance data for all exercises
3. As user navigates through exercises, previous data is displayed above the input section
4. User can see:
   - When they last performed this exercise
   - What weights and reps they used for each set
   - Their top set and total volume
5. User can use this information to:
   - Match or exceed their previous performance
   - Track progressive overload
   - Make informed decisions about weight selection

## Benefits

1. **Progress Tracking**: Users can immediately see if they're improving
2. **Informed Decisions**: No guessing about what weight to use
3. **Motivation**: Clear visualization of progress over time
4. **Consistency**: Helps maintain progressive overload principles
5. **Efficiency**: Batch fetching ensures minimal performance impact

## Performance Considerations

- **Batch Fetching**: Uses `getLastPerformedExercises()` to fetch all exercise data in one go
- **Caching**: Data is stored in state and persists throughout the workout session
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only renders UI if data exists, avoiding unnecessary DOM operations
- **Limited History**: Queries only the last 50 workouts to keep queries fast

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Show trend indicators (up/down arrows) comparing to previous workout
2. Display multiple previous sessions for deeper history
3. Add rep calculator / 1RM estimates
4. Show personal records (PR) for each exercise
5. Add suggested weight based on progression scheme
6. Include rest time comparisons
7. Add RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) data if available

## Testing Notes

To test this feature:
1. Complete a workout with multiple exercises and log weights/reps
2. Start a new workout with the same exercises
3. Previous workout data should appear above the logging inputs
4. Verify that:
   - Dates are formatted correctly
   - Weight units are converted properly
   - All sets are displayed
   - Statistics are calculated correctly
