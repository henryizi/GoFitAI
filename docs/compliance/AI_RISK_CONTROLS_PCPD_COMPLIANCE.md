## 5. BIAS PREVENTION & FAIRNESS CONTROLS

### 5.1 Bias Risk Assessment

#### Identified Bias Risks:
1. **Demographic Bias:** AI may perform differently across age, gender, ethnicity
2. **Body Type Bias:** Algorithms may favor certain body types or fitness levels
3. **Cultural Bias:** Food recognition may be biased toward specific cuisines
4. **Socioeconomic Bias:** Recommendations may assume certain lifestyle capabilities

### 5.2 Bias Mitigation Strategies

#### Training Data Diversity
- Representative sampling across demographics
- Balanced datasets for protected characteristics
- Regular audits of training data composition
- Continuous data collection from underrepresented groups

#### Algorithmic Fairness Testing
```python
# Example bias testing framework
def test_demographic_fairness(model, test_data):
    """Test AI model performance across demographic groups"""
    results = {}
    
    for demographic in ['age_group', 'gender', 'ethnicity']:
        group_performance = {}
        for group in test_data[demographic].unique():
            subset = test_data[test_data[demographic] == group]
            accuracy = model.evaluate(subset)
            group_performance[group] = accuracy
        
        results[demographic] = group_performance
        
        # Flag if performance difference > 5%
        max_diff = max(group_performance.values()) - min(group_performance.values())
        if max_diff > 0.05:
            flag_bias_alert(demographic, max_diff)
    
    return results
```

#### Continuous Monitoring
- Monthly bias audits across user demographics
- Performance monitoring by user segments
- Feedback analysis for bias indicators
- Regular model retraining with updated data

### 5.3 Fairness Metrics

| Metric | Target | Monitoring Frequency |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **Demographic Parity** | <5% difference across groups | Monthly |
| **Equal Opportunity** | <3% difference in true positive rates | Monthly |
| **Individual Fairness** | Similar users get similar results | Continuous |
| **Counterfactual Fairness** | Decisions unaffected by protected attributes | Quarterly |

1. **Fully Automated:** Low-risk decisions (food calorie estimates)
2. **Human-Assisted:** Medium-risk decisions (workout recommendations)
3. **Human-Required:** High-risk decisions (health alerts, medical suggestions)

#### Oversight Requirements:
```typescript
// High-risk decision requiring human review
const processHealthAlert = async (metrics: HealthMetrics, userId: string) => {
  const aiAssessment = await healthAnalysisAI.analyze(metrics);
  
  if (aiAssessment.riskLevel === 'HIGH') {
    // Require human review for high-risk assessments
    const review = await requestHumanReview({
      userId,
      aiAssessment,
      urgency: 'high',
      reviewType: 'health_assessment'
    });
    
    // Only proceed with human approval
    if (review.approved) {
      return review.finalDecision;
    } else {
      return review.alternativeRecommendation;
    }
  }
  
  return aiAssessment;
};
```

### 6.2 Human Review Processes

#### Review Triggers:

## 7. DATA MINIMIZATION & PURPOSE LIMITATION

### 7.1 AI-Specific Data Minimization

#### Training Data Minimization:

- Synthetic data generation where possible
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving model updates

#### Processing Data Minimization:
```typescript
// Example: Minimal data extraction for AI processing
const processBodyImage = async (imageFile: File, userId: string) => {
  // Extract only necessary features, not full image
  const features = await extractBodyFeatures(imageFile);
  
  // Process features, not raw image
  const analysis = await bodyAnalysisAI.analyze(features);
  
  // Delete temporary features immediately
  await deleteTemporaryData(features);
  
  // Store only aggregated results, not raw data
  return {
    bodyFatPercentage: analysis.bodyFat,
    muscleMass: analysis.muscle,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    confidence: analysis.confidence
  };
};
```

### 7.2 Purpose Limitation Controls

#### AI Model Segregation:
- Separate models for different purposes (body analysis vs. food recognition)
- No cross-purpose data sharing between AI systems
- Purpose-specific consent for each AI application

#### Data Usage Auditing:
- Regular audits of AI data usage
- Monitoring for purpose creep or scope expansion
- User consent verification for all AI processing

  rateLimit,             // Prevent abuse
  inputValidation,       // Validate input data
  auditLog               // Log all AI requests
], async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const result = await secureAIProcessing(req.body, req.user.id);
    res.json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    logSecurityEvent('ai_processing_error', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Processing failed' });
  }
});
```

### 8.2 Privacy-Preserving AI Techniques
