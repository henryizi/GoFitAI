## 🎯 **MAJOR PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**

### **❌ PROBLEM 1: OpenRouter API Not Using Your Paid Credits**
**Root Cause:** Server was hardcoded to use FREE Mistral model instead of paid DeepSeek model

**✅ SOLUTION APPLIED:**
- **Fixed server/index.js line 450**: Changed from hardcoded free model to environment variable
- **BEFORE:** `'mistralai/mistral-small-3.2-24b-instruct:free'`  
- **AFTER:** `process.env.OPENROUTER_MODEL || 'deepseek/deepseek-chat'`
- **Result:** ✅ Now using YOUR PAID DeepSeek model with your OpenRouter credits

---

### **❌ PROBLEM 2: Network Connection Failed - Server Unreachable**
**Root Cause:** Client configured for local server (192.168.0.100:4000) but Railway deployment needed

**✅ SOLUTION APPLIED:**
- **Updated .env file**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://gofitai-production.up.railway.app`
- **Synchronized API keys**: Both client and server now use your real OpenRouter key
- **Result:** ✅ App now connects to live Railway server instead of unreachable local server

---

### **❌ PROBLEM 3: Mismatched OpenRouter API Keys**
**Root Cause:** Client and server were using different API keys

**✅ SOLUTION APPLIED:**
- **Client (.env):** `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=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`
- **Server (.env):** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=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`
- **Result:** ✅ Both client and server now use YOUR REAL OpenRouter API key
