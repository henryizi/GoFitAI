# OpenRouter Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed all OpenRouter dependencies and references from the SnapBodyAI application, transitioning to use DeepSeek and Cloudflare as the primary AI providers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Removed `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `OPENROUTER_MODEL` environment variables
- Updated provider configuration to focus on DeepSeek and Cloudflare
- Cleaned up legacy OpenRouter configuration

### 2. Server Code Updates (`server/index.js`)
- Removed OpenRouter API key configuration
- Removed `resolveOpenRouterModel()` function
- Updated `getModelForProvider()` to use OpenAI model as fallback instead of OpenRouter
- Cleaned up workout analysis provider selection logic
- Cleaned up food analysis provider selection logic
- Updated comments to reflect current provider choices

### 3. Provider Configuration
- Removed OpenRouter from the AI providers list
- Updated provider priority to focus on DeepSeek first, then OpenAI, then Cloudflare
- Maintained fallback provider for rule-based responses

### 4. File Cleanup
- Deleted `openrouter_config.txt`
- Deleted temporary test files (`test.txt`, `clearWorkoutPlans.js`, `clearPlans.js`, `check_env.js`)
- Cleaned up other temporary files

## Current AI Provider Configuration

### Primary Providers (in order of preference):
1. **DeepSeek** - Native API with deepseek-chat model
2. **OpenAI** - GPT-4o-mini for general chat
3. **Cloudflare** - Llama-2-7b-chat for fallback
4. **Fallback** - Rule-based responses as last resort

### Vision Analysis:
- **Cloudflare** - Llava-1.5-7b-hf for food image analysis
- **DeepSeek** - Does not support vision, so Cloudflare is used for image processing

## Server Status
✅ Server is running successfully on port 4000
✅ Health endpoint responding correctly
✅ All OpenRouter references removed
✅ No syntax errors or linter issues

## Testing Results
- `/ping` endpoint: ✅ Working
- `/api/health` endpoint: ✅ Working
- Provider configuration: ✅ DeepSeek configured as primary
- No OpenRouter references remaining: ✅ Confirmed

## Next Steps
The application is now ready for production use with the updated AI provider configuration. The transition from OpenRouter to DeepSeek/Cloudflare is complete and the server is functioning properly.

## Environment Variables Required
Make sure these environment variables are set:
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` - For primary AI functionality
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For fallback AI functionality  
- `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CF_API_TOKEN` - For vision analysis
- `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - For database operations
