## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Be Consistent**: Stick to your generated plan for at least 4 weeks
2. **Track Progress**: Log every workout in the app
3. **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase weight/reps each week
4. **Rest Days**: Don't skip them! Recovery is crucial
5. **Nutrition**: Match your diet to your goal (surplus for muscle, deficit for fat loss)

### When to Regenerate:
- After completing 8 weeks (full mesocycle)
- When goals change (e.g., muscle gain → fat loss)
- If schedule changes (e.g., 4 days → 6 days)
- When advancing to new training level
