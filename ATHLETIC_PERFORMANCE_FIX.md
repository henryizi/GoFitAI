# Athletic Performance Goal Fix - Summary

## Problem
When generating workout plans with `primaryGoal: "athletic_performance"`, the Railway server was:
1. **Ignoring the user's goal** and defaulting to `"general_fitness"`
2. Not properly normalizing the profile data format from the app
3. Not building a detailed prompt with the user's goal

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Wrong Server File on Railway
Railway was using `server/index-railway-clean.js` (configured in `railway.json`), which had outdated workout generation logic.

### Issue 2: Missing Profile Normalization
The app sends profile data as:
```javascript
{
  userProfile: {
    fullName: "John Doe",
    primaryGoal: "athletic_performance",  // camelCase
    fitnessLevel: "intermediate",
    workoutFrequency: "4_5"
  }
}
```

But the server/AI expected:
```javascript
{
  full_name: "John Doe",
  primary_goal: "athletic_performance",  // snake_case
  training_level: "intermediate",
  workout_frequency: "4_5"
}
```

### Issue 3: Missing Prompt Composition
The Railway server was calling:
```javascript
geminiTextService.generateWorkoutPlan(profileData, preferences)
```

But `geminiTextService` expects a **prompt string**, not profile objects:
```javascript
geminiTextService.generateWorkoutPlan(promptString)
```

## Solution Applied

### Changes to `server/index-railway-clean.js`:

1. **Added Profile Normalization** (lines 384-405)
   - Convert `camelCase` fields from app to `snake_case` for AI prompt
   - Map `fitnessLevel` ‚Üí `training_level`
   - Map `primaryGoal` ‚Üí `primary_goal`
   - Map `workoutFrequency` ‚Üí `workout_frequency`

2. **Added Helper Functions** (lines 250-367)
   - `formatWorkoutFrequency()` - Format frequency display
   - `getMinFrequency()` - Get minimum workout days
   - `getMaxFrequency()` - Get maximum workout days
   - `getFrequencyExplanation()` - Get detailed frequency instructions
   - `composePrompt()` - Build comprehensive AI prompt with **primary_goal**

3. **Updated Endpoint Logic** (lines 424-430)
   ```javascript
   // OLD (broken):
   const plan = await geminiTextService.generateWorkoutPlan(profileData, preferences);
   
   // NEW (fixed):
   const prompt = composePrompt(profileData);
   console.log('[WORKOUT] Generated prompt with primary_goal:', profileData.primary_goal);
   const plan = await geminiTextService.generateWorkoutPlan(prompt);
   ```

## Key Fix: The Prompt Now Includes Primary Goal

The `composePrompt()` function explicitly includes:
```
CLIENT PROFILE:
- Full Name: John Doe
- Training Level: intermediate
- Primary Goal: athletic_performance    ‚Üê THIS IS NOW INCLUDED!
- Preferred Workout Frequency: 4-5 times per week

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
5. Ensure the plan matches the client's primary goal: athletic_performance
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before (Broken):
```json
{
  "workoutPlan": {
    "name": "General Fitness Plan",
    "primaryGoal": "general_fitness",    ‚Üê WRONG!
    "weeklySchedule": [...]
  }
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```json
{
  "workoutPlan": {
    "name": "John Doe's Athletic Performance Plan",
    "primaryGoal": "athletic_performance",  ‚Üê CORRECT!
    "weeklySchedule": [
      {
        "day": "Monday",
        "focus": "Power & Explosiveness",
        "exercises": [
          { "name": "Box Jumps", ... },
          { "name": "Power Cleans", ... },
          ...
        ]
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

## Deployment

### Commit:
```
fd4a971 - Fix Railway: Add profile normalization and composePrompt to respect primary_goal
```

### Pushed to:
- GitHub: `origin/main`
- Railway: Auto-deploys from main branch

### Deployment Status:
Railway will automatically rebuild and deploy the updated `server/index-railway-clean.js`.

## Testing

### Manual Test:
1. Wait for Railway deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)
2. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   node test-athletic-performance-fix.js
   ```

### Expected Test Output:
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS: Primary goal "athletic_performance" is PRESERVED!

üìã Weekly Schedule Preview:
  Monday: Power & Explosiveness
    Exercises: Box Jumps, Power Cleans...
  Tuesday: Agility Training
    Exercises: Ladder Drills, Cone Drills...
```

### In-App Test:
1. Open GoFitAI mobile app
2. Go to Workout Plans
3. Create new plan with:
   - Goal: "Athletic Performance"
   - Level: "Intermediate"
   - Frequency: "4-5 days/week"
4. Generate plan
5. Verify plan name includes "Athletic Performance"
6. Verify exercises focus on power, agility, and sport-specific movements

## Files Modified

- `server/index-railway-clean.js` - Railway server file
  - Added profile normalization (18 lines)
  - Added helper functions (118 lines)
  - Updated endpoint to use `composePrompt()`

## Related Issues Fixed

This fix also resolves:
- ‚úÖ Primary goal being ignored for ALL goal types
- ‚úÖ Profile data format mismatch between app and server
- ‚úÖ Missing detailed workout instructions in AI prompt
- ‚úÖ Inconsistent workout frequency handling

## Notes for Future

1. **Profile Format**: The app uses `camelCase`, server/AI uses `snake_case`. Normalization is **required**.

2. **Prompt Composition**: Always use `composePrompt()` to build detailed prompts that include:
   - User profile (name, age, gender)
   - Training level
   - **Primary goal** ‚Üê Critical!
   - Workout frequency
   - Detailed instructions for AI

3. **Railway File**: Railway uses `server/index-railway-clean.js`, not `server/index.js`. Keep both in sync!

4. **Testing**: Always test with different goals:
   - `muscle_gain`
   - `fat_loss`
   - `athletic_performance`
   - `general_fitness`

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ User's `primaryGoal` is preserved in generated plan  
‚úÖ Plan name reflects the goal  
‚úÖ Exercises match the goal type  
‚úÖ Workout structure aligns with goal (e.g., power moves for athletic performance)  
‚úÖ No more defaults to "general_fitness"
